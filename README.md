Information connected to Machine Learning and how to start exploring data science.

To access the Jupyter Notebooks, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. Link to how you can install Jupyter Notebook:
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html

To run all the code in the Jupyter Notebooks, you also need to install all Python libraries that are used in the notebook. To install libraries, use the following commando in a command prompt (Terminal on mac) to install the library:

        pip install <name_of_library> 

Where the <name_of_library> is the name of a python library; for example numpy, sklearn, matplotlib osv.
