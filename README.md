# MachineLearning

Information connected to Machine Learning and how to start exploring data science.

To access the Jupyter Notebooks, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. Link to how you can install Jupyter Notebook:
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html

To run all the code in the Jupyter Notebooks, you also need to install all Python libraries that are used in the notebook. To install libraries, use the commando "pip install <name_of_library>" in a command prompt (Terminal on mac) to install the library.

If the notebook has for example the statement "import numpy as np" (numpy is a pyhton library), then the python library numpy needs to be installed. To install hte numbp library, use the commando "pip install numpy" (where numpy is the <name_of_library>).
