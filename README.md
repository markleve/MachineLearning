# MachineLearning

Information connected to Machine Learning and how to start exploring data science.

## Jupyter Notebook

To access the Jupyter Notebooks, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. Link to how you can install Jupyter Notebook:
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html


Maximize the usability of Jupyter Notebook by installing ezxtensions (for example the extension for collapsing headings):

(guide to how to install the posibility of adding extensions, and then how to add extensions afterwards)

## Installing python libraries

To run all the code in the Jupyter Notebooks, you also need to install all Python libraries that are used in the notebook. To install libraries, use the following commando in a command prompt (Terminal on mac) to install the library:

        pip install <name_of_library> 

Where the <name_of_library> is the name of a python library; for example numpy, sklearn, matplotlib osv.

Note: if you have installed the Jupyter Notebook through an Anaconda installation, you need to install the libraries through the "Anaconda prompt" (instead of the command prompt). An anaconda prompt is installed with the Anaconda installation, and just open this instead of the command prompt. Then write the command "pip install <name_of_library>" there.

## Kaggle - compete in machine learning
